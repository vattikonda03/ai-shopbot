# AI ShopBot – Portfolio Contribution

## Project Summary

AI ShopBot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users in finding products using natural language queries and personalized recommendations. The system does not feature a full e-commerce UI; instead, it focuses entirely on an intelligent chatbot interface built with Streamlit.

## My Contributions:
- Implemented a BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking) algorithm to power the recommendation system.
- Developed intelligent product search with NLP to understand user queries (e.g., "I want shoes under $50").
- Created and integrated a SQLite database to log user queries and AI responses.
- Built a chatbot UI using Streamlit for a simple and testable frontend experience.
- Wrote and executed manual test cases to validate all major system features.
- Uploaded the full project with documentation to GitHub.
